# SOAR-EDR Lab

## Objective  
The **SOAR-EDR Lab** project focuses on deploying a **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** system, seamlessly integrated with **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** using **Tines** and **LimaCharlie**. This project aims to enhance cybersecurity operations by automating incident response, streamlining detection rule validation, and strengthening defensive capabilities through hands-on testing.

## Skills Learned  

- 🔧 **SOAR & EDR Deployment** – Setting up and configuring security automation tools.  
- 🤖 **Incident Response Automation** – Designing and refining automated workflows.  
- 🎯 **Threat Detection & Validation** – Creating, testing, and optimizing detection rules.  
- 💬 **Alerting & Communication** – Integrating Slack for real-time SOC notifications.
